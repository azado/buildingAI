# Project Title

Risk analyse for test cases and AI

## Summary

Calculating risk analys for test cases/scenarios in a certain project.

## Background

Which problems does your idea solve? How common or frequent is this problem? What is your personal motivation? Why is this topic important or interesting?

This is how you make a list, if you need one:
* Are some of the user stories/requirement overlapping each other
* Can the above be merged in some way
* Test cases/scenarios can often be to much
* Regression test of existing code/parts, do we need to regression test everything
* Can it be automated or can AI learning by doing help solve this


## How is it used?

A risk matrix table is often created when checking requirements, user stories and the critical/important cases needed to have an MVP (minimum viable product).

| Likehood    | Severity    |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| Header      | Title       |
| Paragraph   | Text        |

## Data sources and AI methods
Often data is already in the requirements but needed to be entered in and use Naive Bayes classifier with machine learning and working with text

## Challenges

This will not solve the automation but it will probably cut down on time on the regression testing and speeding upp the time to code the automation for the new product in question

## What next?

Both developer, testers and system owners need to be involved in this to get this working and of course an understanding of how AI works in reality.

## Acknowledgments

* As a senior test manager and tester, I can see the potential to use this in test management and risk analysis
