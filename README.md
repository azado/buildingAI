# Project Title

Risk analyse for test cases and AI

## Summary

Calculating risk analys for test cases/scenarios in a certain project.

## Background

Which problems does your idea solve? How common or frequent is this problem? What is your personal motivation? Why is this topic important or interesting?

This is how you make a list, if you need one:
* Are some of the user stories/requirement overlapping each other
* Can the above be merged in some way
* Test cases/scenarios can often be to much
* Regression test of existing code/parts, do we need to regression test everything
* Can it be automated or can AI learning by doing help solve this


## How is it used?

A risk matrix table is often created when checking requirements, user stories and the critical/important cases needed to have an MVP (minimum viable product).

Once you upload an image to your repository, you can link link to it like this (replace the URL with file path, if you've uploaded an image to Github.)

## Data sources and AI methods
Where does your data come from? Do you collect it yourself or do you use data collected by someone else?
If you need to use links, here's an example:

| Syntax      | Description |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| Header      | Title       |
| Paragraph   | Text        |

## Challenges

What does your project _not_ solve? Which limitations and ethical considerations should be taken into account when deploying a solution like this?

## What next?

How could your project grow and become something even more? What kind of skills, what kind of assistance would you  need to move on?
